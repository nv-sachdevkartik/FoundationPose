# Fork of FoundationPose: Unified 6D Pose Estimation and Tracking of Novel Objects
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08344) [[Website]](https://nvlabs.github.io/FoundationPose/)

This is a fork of the [FoundationPose](https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationPose) repository.

Contributors: Bowen Wen, Wei Yang, Jan Kautz, Stan Birchfield

We present FoundationPose, a unified foundation model for 6D object pose estimation and tracking, supporting both model-based and model-free setups. Our approach can be instantly applied at test-time to a novel object without fine-tuning, as long as its CAD model is given, or a small number of reference images are captured. We bridge the gap between these two setups with a neural implicit representation that allows for effective novel view synthesis, keeping the downstream pose estimation modules invariant under the same unified framework. Strong generalizability is achieved via large-scale synthetic training, aided by a large language model (LLM), a novel transformer-based architecture, and contrastive learning formulation. Extensive evaluation on multiple public datasets involving challenging scenarios and objects indicate our unified approach outperforms existing methods specialized for each task by a large margin. In addition, it even achieves comparable results to instance-level methods despite the reduced assumptions.

# TensorRT & Onnx Inference

* Follow the instructions for data and model file structure from [Data prepare](#data-prepare) section above
* Download onnx weights from [FoundationPose NGC Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/isaac/models/foundationpose) and rename them as:

    > 2024-01-11-20-02-45 -> score_model.onnx -> model_best.onnx

    > 2023-10-28-18-33-37 -> refine_model.onnx -> model_best.onnx




# Data prepare


1) Download all network weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DFezOAD0oD1BblsXVxqDsl8fj0qzB82i?usp=sharing) and put them under the folder `weights/`. For the refiner, you will need `2023-10-28-18-33-37`. For scorer, you will need `2024-01-11-20-02-45`.

1) [Download demo data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRyFmxYXmAnpku7nGRioZaKrVJtIsroP?usp=sharing) and extract them under the folder `demo_data/`

1) [Optional] Download our large-scale training data: ["FoundationPose Dataset"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s4pB6p4ApfWMiMjmTXOFco8dHbNXikp-?usp=sharing)

1) [Optional] Download our preprocessed reference views [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PXXCOJqHXwQTbwPwPbGDN9_vLVe0XpFS?usp=sharing) in order to run model-free few-shot version.

# Run model-based demo
The paths have been set in argparse by default. If you need to change the scene, you can pass the args accordingly. By running on the demo data, you should be able to see the robot manipulating the mustard bottle. Pose estimation is conducted on the first frame, then it automatically switches to tracking mode for the rest of the video. The resulting visualizations will be saved to the `debug_dir` specified in the argparse. (Note the first time running could be slower due to online compilation)

```bash
# pytorch
python run_demo.py

# onnx
python run_demo.py --use_onnx

# tensorrt
python run_demo.py --use_tensorrt
```

Feel free to try on other objects (**no need to retrain**) such as driller, by changing the paths in argparse.

# Run on public datasets (LINEMOD, YCB-Video)

For this you first need to download LINEMOD dataset and YCB-Video dataset.

To run model-based version on these two datasets respectively, set the paths based on where you download. The results will be saved to `debug` folder
```
python run_linemod.py --linemod_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/LINEMOD --use_reconstructed_mesh 0

python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 0
```

To run model-free few-shot version. You first need to train Neural Object Field. `ref_view_dir` is based on where you download in the above "Data prepare" section. Set the `dataset` flag to your interested dataset.
```
python bundlesdf/run_nerf.py --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16 --dataset ycbv
```

Then run the similar command as the model-based version with some small modifications. Here we are using YCB-Video as example:
```
python run_ycb_video.py --ycbv_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video --use_reconstructed_mesh 1 --ref_view_dir /mnt/9a72c439-d0a7-45e8-8d20-d7a235d02763/DATASET/YCB_Video/bowen_addon/ref_views_16
```

  cd onnx-tensorrt
  pip install tensorrt
  ```

- To parse the camera params including extrinsics and intrinsics
  ```
  glcam_in_cvcam = np.array([[1,0,0,0],
                          [0,-1,0,0],
                          [0,0,-1,0],
                          [0,0,0,1]]).astype(float)
  W, H = camera_params["renderProductResolution"]
  with open(f'{base_dir}/camera_params/camera_params_000000.json','r') as ff:
    camera_params = json.load(ff)
  world_in_glcam = np.array(camera_params['cameraViewTransform']).reshape(4,4).T
  cam_in_world = np.linalg.inv(world_in_glcam)@glcam_in_cvcam
  world_in_cam = np.linalg.inv(cam_in_world)
  focal_length = camera_params["cameraFocalLength"]
  horiz_aperture = camera_params["cameraAperture"][0]
  vert_aperture = H / W * horiz_aperture
  focal_y = H * focal_length / vert_aperture
  focal_x = W * focal_length / horiz_aperture
  center_y = H * 0.5
  center_x = W * 0.5

  fx, fy, cx, cy = focal_x, focal_y, center_x, center_y
  K = np.eye(3)
  K[0,0] = fx
  K[1,1] = fy
  K[0,2] = cx
  K[1,2] = cy
  ```


# Notes
Due to the legal restrictions of Stable-Diffusion that is trained on LAION dataset, we are not able to release the diffusion-based texture augmented data, nor the pretrained weights using it. We thus release the version without training on diffusion-augmented data. Slight performance degradation is expected.

We would like to thank Jeff Smith for helping with the code release; NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Omniverse team for the support on synthetic data generation; Tianshi Cao for the valuable discussions. Finally, we are also grateful for the positive feebacks and constructive suggestions brought up by reviewers and AC at CVPR.
